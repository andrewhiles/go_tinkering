# go_tinkering
A collection of basic projects written in Go - https://golang.org/

This repo will probably not be of much use to those familiar with the language and its core packages but will be suitable(over time) for those who are just getting started with the language and all that a functional language like Go can provide.

Over time this collection will grow - that's a promise :)
